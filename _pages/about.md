Hello! I’m Tiankai Yang, a first-year PhD student of Computer Science at the University of Southern California (USC), supervised by Prof. [Yue Zhao](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~yzhao010/index.html). Prior, I earned a Master’s degree in Machine Learning and Data Science from USC and a Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering from Nankai University, China. 

My research focuses on anomaly detection, out-of-distribution detection, and enhancing the robustness and trustworthiness of machine learning models, particularly in the realm of large language models (LLMs).
